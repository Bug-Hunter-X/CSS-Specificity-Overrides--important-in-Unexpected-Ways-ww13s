The solution involves understanding specificity and avoiding unnecessary use of `!important`. If the desired style for the paragraph should be green, keep the current selector and remove the `!important` declaration from the parent selector.

Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.child p {
  color: green;
}
```

By removing the `!important` and instead managing the style using the typical CSS cascade, the specificity is handled naturally, and the paragraph text is styled in green correctly.
